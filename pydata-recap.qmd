# Introduction {background-image="assets/images/chat-gpt-takes-manhattan.png"}

::: notes
ChatGPT was there, but as a friendly guest more than the conqueror of worlds it's become in other contexts. The emphasis was still on Python, and the big theme seemed to be the emergence of credible competitors to streamlit - Taipy and especially Quarto / Posit. It's traditional in this kind of presentation to shock you with the revelation that I wrote it using the tools I learned about at the conference, and using AI, so let's get this out of the way - I wrote this presentation in Quarto for Reveal.js, and planned the whole thing out using ChatGPT. You can follow along with us n this link:

# Time Warp {background-image="assets/images/gpt-time-machine.png"}

::: notes
PyData 2022's last day was November. On November 30th, 2022, OpenAI made ChatGPT available. It didn't change everything, but it changed a whole lot. Notably, I didn't see people using some of ChatGPT's more interesting capabilities, like automated data analysis. It's not something the people there would want or need. But, it is something that non-DS people should know about and use.

# Keynote

## AI and the Stuff Built for AI {background-image="assets/images/renaissance-cat.png"}

Keynote by Souminth Chintala, Meta Fellow & co-creator of PyTorch

::: notes
We had a great keynote from Souminth Chintala, Meta Fellow and one of the architects of PyTorch. One of the important points he brings up is that we have been conditioned to associate eloquence with intelligence, and ChatGPT is very, very eloquent. We look at this image and think "What an intelligent cat!". Similarly, the chat interface and even touches like ChatGPT apparently "typing" in response to us are meant to preserve the illusion that we are talking to another consciousness. But we aren't! And you have to be aware of that fact when it gives you answers.

## What is Data Science for?

![](assets/images/data-scientists.png)

::: notes
There's a temptation to think that we can somehow use tools like ChatGPT to automatically get the insights that we receive now using data science tools. The thing that's missing from that picture is our judgment and our reasoning, which is what produces the insight. We have to really know and understand the process and the business, and that's not something we can automate. It takes a lot of effort to step out of the maze and try to really see what's going on, and we bring a lot of our humanity to the job, not just the tools we use.

``` notes
One of the big themes this year was the idea of getting our analysis in front of customers in more engaging ways. Streamlit has been here for a long time and partnered with Vizzu this year, a new visualization company. TaiPy was also present, though I haven't played with their tools yet. The big story was Quarto, from Posit. Posit was RStudio, and has been renamed to reflect its new tool-agnostic emphasis. They also made a splashy hire, announcing that Wes McKinney (creator of Pandas) was joining the company. I was very impressed with what I saw, which includes the tools I used to make this presentation and my personal blog! But, in terms of impact to our daily lives, the big one is likely to be Python in Excel. Get ready for lots of interest from Finance departments as Microsoft starts blasting this out to them.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation

![](assets/images/retrieval-augmented-generation.png){fig-alt="Workflow of Retrieval Augmented Generation systems"}

::: notes
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) was a popular topic, with two sessions dedicated to building example apps. It reflects a reality that the tools are wonderfully useful, but only on the things they have been trained on. Of course, mere days after this conference OpenAI announced that the ChatGPT knowledge base had been pushed forward to April 2023. They really do enjoy keeping us on our toes. There were several sessions on this tech. But, it seems like one of the problems here, and a problem for LLMs in general, is that no one knows for sure how (or if) this really works.

## Palmer's Penguins vs. Iris Dataset

::: notes
In back-to-back sessions, I noticed that instructors were using the "Palmer's Penguins" dataset. I thought that was interesting and asked why - it turns out that the author of the Iris dataset was a eugenicist, and so that dataset is considered in bad taste to use. That could be important, depending on your audience, and especially important if you are preparing tutorials or otherwise using datasets to investigate tool capabilities.

## Ibis Deferred Operator!

``` {#ibis .python}
import ibis 
from ibis import _
cnxn = ibis.sqlite.connect("data/census2000names.sqlite")
surnames_t = cnxn.table("surnames")
data = surnames_t.filter((_.name == "SMITH")|(_["rank"] ==1)).select(
    _.year, _.name, _["rank"], _["count"]).execute()
```

```{python}
import ibis 
from ibis import _
cnxn = ibis.sqlite.connect("data/census2000names.sqlite")
surnames_t = cnxn.table("surnames")
data = surnames_t.filter((_.name == "SMITH")|(_["rank"] ==1)).select(
    _.year, _.name, _["rank"], _["count"]).execute()
data
```

::: notes
I first heard of Ibis at last year's PyData, and started playing with it immediately. In just one year, it's gone through 3 major versions, added more backends, and in general gotten a lot more impressive. But, it was little features that really blew my mind. For example, the "deferred" operator, which has already saved me so much typing. It's so fantastically useful, making statements both shorter and more flexible. It goes to show that there's always something new to learn, even for things you think that you know.

# Using ChatGPT for Work

## How should we think about AI?

![](assets/images/what-is-ai-for.png)

::: notes
It's tempting, and premature, to think that tools like DALL-E and ChatGPT will replace artists and programmers, respectively. My feeling is that they won't, but it took me a long time to get here and to get over my initial fear of these things. I love programming, and I imagine artists love doing their art just as much. I don't think that will ever go away. What these tools do, though, is accelerate us and give us access to capabilities we don't otherwise have. It's not going to replace the people doing the work, it's going to allow people who never had access to these things before to join in and contribute. I don't see how that can be anything but good for all of us. There aren't enough graphic artists and computer programmers in the world to bring their gifts everywhere they are needed - but this brings some light into otherwise dark corners.

## The Promise and the Peril

![](assets/images/panik_kalm_panik.jpg){fig-align="center"}

::: notes
I don't think AI will ultimately replace us. I think what it will do is accelerate delivery of things, and make our presentations and work more impactful. And as we all probably know, the reward for doing a good job is to be asked to do more of it, and faster.
